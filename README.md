# Data_Analytics_Final_Portfolio_Codecademy
Your data analytics portfolio is your secret weapon when applying for potential positions. It should not only show off your skills and experience but give your interviewers insight into how you tackle data analytics problems. Your portfolio should highlight to hiring managers how you thought about, worked through, and visualized your results. In this final portfolio project, you’ll use your understanding of data analytics and visualization to answer a question about a topic of your choosing.

For this project, you will conduct your own analysis in a Jupyter Notebook and share your results through your personal GitHub page. This project can be included as part of your portfolio when you apply for data scientist and data analyst jobs. It’s good practice to showcase a variety of skills in order to make your application shine.
